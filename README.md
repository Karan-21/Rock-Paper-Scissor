# Rock-Paper-Scissor

- Lead a 2-person group project where we built a text-based Rock Paper Scissor Game in C++. This game is totally automated from computer end as every time you play, computer gives a random input.  

-Then we built a real tournament for playing the game, also I added some AI components like if the number of players or not the multiple of four then the remaining players will be automatically added and will be treated as a computer. 

-And my team mate also automated the process of grouping the players and keeping the track who wins and then the winners of rest of the tournament will play in the finals.

-Lastly, I build a proper documentation of the game with all types of UML diagrams and goals for every week of the project work we use to do and will do and my team member did all type of testing like Unit, Regression and many more.
